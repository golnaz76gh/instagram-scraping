It\u2019s not always easy for me to admit when I\u2019m down and a lot of my healing around that has come through friendships where I feel safe and seen, where I trust that my lovability and worth are not dependent upon my being \u2018up\u2019 all the time. Jon\u2019s one of those friends with whom I feel like I can show up exactly as I am. Anyway I mentioned I was down and he texted me the most glorious pep talk. I won\u2019t share it here but I\u2019ll just say it totally reoriented me. He reminded me who I was while also giving me permission to feel exactly how I felt. As some of you may know Jon is also my favorite artist and has done a ton of art for me over the years (movie posters, album covers, etc.) I asked him to design the cover for my EP and he came back with the design posted above. I ended up going with another cover but Jon\u2019s pass at it is dear to my heart. All of which is to say, when you feel low and uninspired it\u2019s great to have friends who see you as a forest mountain king.\n17w",
